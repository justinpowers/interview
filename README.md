Some incremental updates on the original just to clear my head. And for practice.

Initial commit contains the initial cleanup and functionalization, for readability.

Ideally, I'll get around to creating a quick select fn to really speed it up.

Most comments within code meant to show intent and preferred final form.
If I find time, I'll follow through by implementing these intentions, but first
it's probably wiser for me to just spend time just refreshing my algo and big-O
knowledge since my day-to-day programming hasn't kept the specifics as fresh
as I'd like.
